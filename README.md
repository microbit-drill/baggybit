A picture paints a thousand words, but some words are needed.

- on the left and right hand side of the green pcb, as many big holes/connectors for crocodile clips for safe connection to i/o 
- the green area should have place for i2c and connections to left and right side big holes
- the bottom part of the green area should have the normal micro:bit connection to expansion except
 - big holes are not plated thru, ie the two sides are not connected
 - the black small connector to allow rerouting of i/o: may need two parrallel connectors with more space than jumpers
